        <div class="desc"><p>My opinion is that cooking is the best hobby to have, because it can be very useful in life. Cooking is my hobby and has been for several years.
            I have always loved being in the kitchen, experimenting with different ingredients and techniques to create delicious and satisfying meals. I find cooking to be therapeutic and relaxing, and it brings me a great sense of fulfillment and enjoyment.
One of the reasons I love cooking is that it allows me to be creative and to experiment with different flavors and
 textures. I enjoy trying out new recipes and coming up with my own creations. I also love to try out different cuisines and to learn about the various cooking styles and ingredients from around the world.
 Cooking gives me the freedom to be creative and to express myself through my food.
